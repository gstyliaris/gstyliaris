You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you‚Äôll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!

The major differences are:\nYou cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc. There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday‚Äôs Markdown and Pandoc‚Äôs Markdown. For example, you can write a task list with Blackfriday but not with Pandoc:\nWrite an R package. Write a book. ‚Ä¶ Profit! Similarly, Blackfriday does not support LaTeX math and Pandoc does. I have added the MathJax support to this theme (hugo-lithium) but there is a caveat for plain Markdown posts: you have to include math expressions in a pair of backticks (inline: `$ $`; display style: `$$ $$`), e.g., $S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$.^[This is because we have to protect the math expressions from being interpreted as Markdown. You may not need the backticks if your math expression does not contain any special Markdown syntax such as underscores or asterisks, but it is always a safer choice to use backticks. When you happen to have a pair of literal dollar signs inside the same element, you can escape one dollar sign, e.g., \\$50 and $100 renders ‚Äú$50 and $100‚Äù.] For R Markdown posts, you do not need the backticks, because Pandoc can identify and process math expressions.\nWhen creating a new post, you have to decide whether the post format is Markdown or R Markdown, and this can be done via the ext argument of the function blogdown::new_post(), e.g.\nblogdown::new_post(\u0026#34;Post Title\u0026#34;, ext = \u0026#39;.Rmd\u0026#39;) ","date":1483159797,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483159797,"objectID":"0754333f7dffce453322635ff41b5c9f","permalink":"https://example.com/post/2016-12-30-hello-markdown/","publishdate":"2016-12-30T21:49:57-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/2016-12-30-hello-markdown/","section":"post","summary":"This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd).

Figure from PRL (2024). Measurements are often solely thought of as means to extract information from a quantum state. However, measurement can also be used as an active ingredient in quantum protocols. This line of work explores how the resources (such as circuit depth) needed to transform a given state to a target one can be drastically reduced by utilizing measurements.\nThe problem of state preparation is evidently motivated by the practical need to prepare states in quantum devices, e.g., for quantum computing and simulation. However, it also has a more fundamental flavor to it since it connects to the classification of topological phases. It turns out that measurements can significantly lower the complexity for the preparation of states, which implies that certain topological phases collapse when measurements are considered.\nSelected Publications: Phases of Matrix Product States with Symmetric Quantum Circuits and Symmetric Measurements with Feedforward,\nGunn, Styliaris, Kraft, Kraus [PRB (2025)] Characterizing MPS and PEPS Preparable via Measurement and Feedback,\nZhang, Gopalakrishnan, Styliaris [PRX Quantum (2024)] Approximating many-body quantum states with quantum circuits and measurements,\nPiroli, Styliaris, Cirac [PRL (2024)] Preparation of Matrix Product States with Log-Depth Quantum Circuits,\nMalz*, Styliaris*, Wei*, Cirac [PRL (2024)] [Talk at TQC 2024 @OIST] Quantum Circuits Assisted by Local Operation and Classical Communication: Transformations and Phases of Matter,\nPiroli, Styliaris, Cirac [PRL (2021)] [Talk at QIP 2022 @Caltech] Theory of tensor networks Multiple copies of a random tensor network. Figure from PRX Quantum (2023). The many-body Hilbert space is large, as it grows exponentially with the number of constituents [‚Äúno one can hear you scream there‚Äù, as I learned from Todd Brun]. However, when interactions are local, the corresponding low-energy eigenstates are captured by tensor-networks. This not only allows for an efficient description of the relevant quantum states, but also provides a general framework for many-body physics, in the language of quantum information.\nSelected Publications: Matrix-product unitaries: Beyond quantum cellular automata,\nStyliaris, Trivedi, P√©rez-Garc√≠a, Cirac [Quantum (2025)] Parent Lindbladians for Matrix Product Density Operators,\nLiu, Ruiz-de-Alarc√≥n, Styliaris, Sun, P√©rez-Garc√≠a, Cirac [arXiv (2025)]\nTypical Correlation Length of Sequentially Generated Tensor Network States,\nHaag, Baccari, Styliaris [PRX Quantum (2023)] Exactly solvable quantum states and dynamics A quantum circuit of space-time quantum channels. Figure from Quantum (2023). Dual-unitary circuits have emerged as a rich model of quantum dynamics. While this class includes both integrable and chaotic models, it allows for the analytical solution of correlation functions. The defining property of these circuits is that, when the role of space and time is exchanged, the corresponding evolution remains physical, i.e., unitary.\nNo realistic quantum system is perfectly isolated. Fortunately, it turns out that the ideas of dual-unitarity can be extended to the realm of open systems. Here we explore how, by postulating the analogous symmetry between space and time, solvability is extended to quantum channels.\nThe same ideas allow to define a nontrivial subclass of 2D tensor-network states with exactly solvable single and 2-body correlation functions. The connection can be understood by interpreting the tensor-network contraction as evolution over the virtual space.\nSelected Publications: Dual-isometric Projected Entangled Pair States,\nYu, Cirac, Kos*, Styliaris* [PRL (2024)] Circuits of space and time quantum channels,\nKos*, Styliaris* [Quantum (2023)] [Perspective on our article by Shane Dooley] Quantum information theory \u0026amp; Quantum computing Symmetries in Markovian dynamics give rise to monotones.

I am an [MCQST START Fellow](https://www.mcqst.de/support/start-fellowship/) (Sep 2025--Aug 2027) hosted at the group of [Ignacio Cirac](https://www.mpq.mpg.de/6497409/prof-dr-ignacio-cirac) in [MPQ](https://www.mpq.mpg.de/6497359/theory-homepage). I fisrt joined MPQ in September of 2020, where I have been a Postdoctoral Researcher and a [Humboldt Fellow](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/).

Before that I was at the [Physics Department of USC](https://dornsife.usc.edu/physics/) in Los Angeles, where I obtained my PhD in *Quantum Information Theory* under [Paolo Zanardi](https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/paolo-zanardi/). My thesis was awarded the [CAMS Graduate Student Prize](https://dornsife.usc.edu/cams/cams-prize/) by the Department of Mathematics.

I grew up in Greece, where in 2015 I earned my bachelor's degree in Physics (valedictorian) from the [University of Athens](https://en.phys.uoa.gr/) with a specialization in *Nuclear & Particle Physics*.

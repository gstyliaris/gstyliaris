I am a post-doc in the group of [Ignacio Cirac](https://www.mpq.mpg.de/6497409/prof-dr-ignacio-cirac) at [MPQ](https://www.mpq.mpg.de/en) in Munich.

From September 2025, I will be an **[MCQST START Fellow](https://www.mcqst.de/support/start-fellowship/)** hosted at MPQ.

I am a theoretical physicist working on the interface of **quantum information theory** and **many-body physics**.

My research consists of developing **quantum-information tools** and applying them to problems in **quantum physics** with the motivation to understand *possibilities and limitations* of **quantum technologies**.
